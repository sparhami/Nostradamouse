            <p>
                When clicking the 'settings' button above, Nostradamouse will
                load the definition for x-settings. On the first page load, it will
                just load x-settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the second load, it will use the dependency information from the
                previous page load to request the dependencies upfront without having
                to wait for a round trip to discover them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to render the settings dialog, there are four round trips
                that need to be made in order to load all the dependencies needed.
                With the dependency information being cached, it can be done in two.
                The final round trip is needed to get the script and style
                dependencies used by any components.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you look in your dev tools, you may notice that while all the
                dependencies are requested up front, only approximately 6 are
                retrieved at any given time. If you use SPDY to serve the page,
                then all the dependencies will be loaded in parallel.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do a localStorage.clear() in your dev tools, you can
                reload the page again to compare how the loading looks like
                without the dependencies cached. You may also find it useful
                to inject artificial latency on your network requests to get
                a feel for how the depenecy caching will be useful when a user
                has a poor network connection.
