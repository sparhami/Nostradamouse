            <h2>Autosuggest</h2>

            <p>
                A simple autosuggest component. Uses an input element, instantiated inside the custom element so that the component has a representation on the UI before the component definition loads. While the component is rather small, a more complex autosuggest might bring significant additional payload to a page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The demo page loads the component definition on mouseover or focus, which ever comes first. Given the timescales humans operate on, the component will likely be ready before the user has typed their first letter.
